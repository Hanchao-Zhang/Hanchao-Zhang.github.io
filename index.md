## About Me

I'm a <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/student/chen-chen/" target="_blank"> Environmental Engineering </a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank"> Rice University</a>'s <a href="https://cee.rice.edu/" target="_blank"> George R. Brown School of Engineering</a> in Houston, TX, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/daniel-cohan" target="_blank"> Daniel S. Cohan</a>. My research involves marco energy system modeling and optimization.

I obtained my M.S. in Environmental Sciences from <a href="https://www.emory.edu" target = "_blank"> Emory University</a>, Atlanta, GA in 2018. I also hold a B.S. with Honor in Marine Science and Chemistry, with a minor in Mathematics and Geology, from <a href="https://www.miami.edu" target = "_blank"> University of Miami</a>, Coral Gables, FL.

My research are highly focusing on marco energy transition and modeling, with investigation into four pillars: 1) economic, 2) social-environmental, 3) technological, and 4) policy. My recent papers highlighted the human health impacts from natural gas flaring, the future opportunity of geothermal in energy transition, and energy reliablity analysis in Texas. I am an experienced quantitative and geospatial data scientist and self-taught developer.
