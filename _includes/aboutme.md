## About Me

I work as a Research Data Scientist at Google, where our team uses statistical methods to analyze complex strategic questions, optimize decision-making, and solve key challenges across the company. Before joining Google, I completed my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QtyFQVYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Thaddeus Tarpey</a>. My research involves developing statistical models that cater to high-dimensional complex data, such as functional and imaging data. This endeavor confronts two main challenges: first, defining a metric with self-consistent properties to cluster populations into subgroups based on rich and complex tensor data; second, accurately identifying subgroups that closely align with target labels of interest by developing methods like semi-supervised clustering algorithms.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.idiaz.xyz" target="_blank">Iván Díaz</a>.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank">National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in diving, oil painting, and aeromodelling.
